\title{Visualize the dimensional reduction plot with scRank prioritization result}
\usage{
plot_dim(
  object,
  coordinate = NULL,
  color = NULL,
  point_size = 0.5,
  box_padding = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{scRank object generated from \code{\link{rank_celltype}}}

\item{coordinate}{a dataframe containing the low dimensional coordinates for each cells. The row name is the cell name identical with cell name in data of scRank object.}

\item{color}{a vector containing continuous color used to visualize cell type rank. Default is the viridis color.}

\item{point_size}{point size. Default is \code{0.5}}

\item{box_padding}{Amount of padding around bounding box, as unit or number. Default is \code{0.5}}
}
