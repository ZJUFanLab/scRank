\title{Constructing cell-type-specific GRN for single-cell transcriptomics data}
\usage{
Constr_net(
  object,
  min_cells = 25,
  select_ratio = 0.5,
  n_selection = 10,
  cut_ratio = 0.95,
  n.core = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{scRank object generated from \code{\link{CreateScRank}}.}

\item{min_cells}{the minimum number of cells in a particular cell type retained for constructing robust scGRN. Cell type with cells lower than \code{min_cells} will be droped. Default is 25.}

\item{select_ratio}{percent cells of total cells to be selected in random selection. Default is 0.5.}

\item{n_selection}{number of selection to create \code{n_selection} networks for a cell type. Default is 10.}

\item{cut_ratio}{threshold of top percent edge weight to be cut. Edge with weight lower than the threshold will be cut. Default is 0.95.}

\item{n.core}{Number of CPU cores to use. Default is all cores - 1.}
}
\value{
scRank object containing the gene regulatory network for every cell type.
}
\description{
construct gene-gene co-expression adjacency matrix for every cell type with regression strategy.
